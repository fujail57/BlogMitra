# Front-End Development Internship Assignment

## Project Setup

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

To set up the project:

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fujail57/BlogMitra.git
cd [repository-name]
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:8000` (or another port if 8000 is in use).
